# Deployment Summary

Your app is deployed to AWS! Preview URL: https://d36wd7f6erioxo.cloudfront.net/react-native-keyboard-controller/index.html

**Next Step: Automate Deployments**

You're currently using manual deployment. To automate deployments from GitHub, ask your coding agent to set up AWS CodePipeline using an agent SOP for pipeline creation. Try: "create a pipeline using AWS SOPs"

Services used: CloudFront, S3, CloudFormation, IAM

Questions? Ask your Coding Agent:
 - What resources were deployed to AWS?
 - How do I update my deployment?

## Quick Commands

```bash
# View deployment status
aws cloudformation describe-stacks --stack-name "RNKeyboardFrontend-preview-sergeyka" --query 'Stacks[0].StackStatus' --output text

# Invalidate CloudFront cache
aws cloudfront create-invalidation --distribution-id "E1Z73IA0TTBWGD" --paths "/*"

# View CloudFront access logs (last hour)
aws s3 ls "s3://rnkeyboardfrontend-previe-cftos3cloudfrontloggingb-qqf8ue1owqgr/" --recursive | tail -20

# Redeploy
./scripts/deploy.sh
```

## Production Readiness

For production deployments, consider:
- WAF Protection: Add AWS WAF with managed rules (Core Rule Set, Known Bad Inputs) and rate limiting
- CSP Headers: Configure Content Security Policy in CloudFront response headers (`script-src 'self'`, `frame-ancestors 'none'`)
- Custom Domain: Set up Route 53 and ACM certificate
- Monitoring: CloudWatch alarms for 4xx/5xx errors and CloudFront metrics
- Auth Redirect URLs: If using an auth provider (Auth0, Supabase, Firebase, Lovable, etc.), add your CloudFront URL to allowed redirect URLs
